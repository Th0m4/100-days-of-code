# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: October 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Start scheduling my 100DaysOfCode

**Thoughts:** To put me back in the code, I will start my #100DaysOfCode with 1 week to relearn basic of HTML and 1 week basic of CSS. Then I'll learn JavaScript from the beginning during maybe 2 weeks.
